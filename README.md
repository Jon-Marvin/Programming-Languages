**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
This project was created to display both a 12 and 24 hour clock. The clock had to be functional with user inputs adding one second, one minute, or one hour at a time.

**What did you do particularly well?**
The layout and menu of the clock were easy to navigate. I thought the finished product looked clean and useable in a real application setting.

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**
The main issue I had with the code was making the clock actually function. I was unable to create a fully working clock, but the project itself met the criteria. I had been trying to make it count as a real clock would, but I found it was beyond my talent.

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**
I found the menu loop to be difficult to implement at first. I had to do some extra research after multiple efforts ended with endless loops, but I did manage to get it working after five or six trials. Stackoverflow was essential in bypassing the endless loop. I had read over multiple posts before finding a solution to my problem, and I greatly admire the programmers who go on the site to help beginners.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**
User input was the biggest part of this that I found transferrable. Being that each project (and most of the assignments) we had required some sort of user input, this was a good place to start. The simple menu options made it easy to save the input for use in other projects and helped me get through those parts a little faster, as I had already done it.

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I did my best to use correct spacing and inline comments where needed. Explaining each step is a good way to help someone understand the application even if they don't understand the code. This code is a good starting point for a fully functional clock. I would have to do some more research to get it to work, but that's for another time.
